The following report is the result of my Master's thesis work for the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU) at the Department of Electronics and Telecommunications. This thesis is a continuation of a project I worked on last semester on the same topic. In the project I got familiarised with voice transformation and implemented some fundamental algorithms used in my Master's thesis. Every code line was made from scratch, which entailed many hours of debugging in both semesters. Even though, it has been inspiring and joyful to work on such a new and experimental research topic.

I would like to express my special thanks to my advisor, Torbj√∏rn Svendsen, for great talks and guidance in our weekly meetings.
