task:

Voice Transformation refers to the process of modifying a voice from a speaker so that it sounds like it has been produced by a different speaker. The main speaker-specific characteristics are determined by the short range frequency spectrum and the fundamental frequency of the vocal cords. This work will be based on a project that implemented a system for filter transformation based on Gaussian mixture models. Variants and improvements of the basic system will be studied, and selected solution should be implemented and evaluated. If time permits, one should also study methods for excitation transformation.
