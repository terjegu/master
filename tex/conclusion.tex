\begin{itemize}
	\item In $f_0$ transformation: transformed CC as input is not good
	\item codebook of excitation signals m=16, n=80
	\item Gain transformation
	\item need more training data and mixtures, cite LSF for different approach
	\item major shortcomings is lack of time-scale transformation
	\begin{itemize}
		\item ok if source speaker tries to imposture a target speaker
		\item not ok to create a random voice from a synthetic voice.
		\item use basic dtw to find a one-to-many mapping or many-to-one
	\end{itemize}
